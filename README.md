# practiceTask
<p>As per the requirement of the project task, a GuestBook has been made using HTML5, Bootstrap, AngularJS, PHP, and mySQL database.
The project has been made in the cloud environment (codeanywhere.com) and has been linked with github using version control system.
Credentials for cloud environment can be given on request...
The description of files and folders in the project environment is mentioned below:</p>
<p>A responsive design has been made using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap (index.html) where many extra setting have been put for future 
modifications. AngularJS has been used to fetch the data from PHP file (external.js and DAL.php) which fetch data from the database. 
On the other hand, to post the data into the database table, php file has been used (postdesc.php). In conclusion, the data has been fetched and posted using both the techniques just 
to implement two different variations.
The design has many flaws and can be improved much much better; but it has been implmeneted for the sake of delivering the project with 
functional requirements.</p>
